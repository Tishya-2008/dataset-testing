Creating a multinomial regression model using Python and sci-kit learn

Install the required libraries using: pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
Run the script in the terminal by typing python main.py or python3 main.py (dependent on your version of python)


The program should output the model's confusion matrix as well as a classification with its precision, recall, f1-score, and accuracy.
