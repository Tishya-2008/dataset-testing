# Multinomial Regression Model Evaluation - README

## **1. Metrics for Each Category**
The classification report evaluates the model's performance for each target class (`High`, `Low`, `Medium`, `Very High`) using the following metrics:

### **Precision**
- **Definition:** The percentage of predicted instances for a class that were correct.
- **Formula:** 
  \[
  \text{Precision} = \frac{\text{True Positives}}{\text{True Positives} + \text{False Positives}}
  \]
- **Example:** For `High`, a precision of `0.25` means that only 25% of the instances predicted as `High` were correct.

### **Recall (Sensitivity)**
- **Definition:** The percentage of actual instances of a class that the model correctly identified.
- **Formula:** 
  \[
  \text{Recall} = \frac{\text{True Positives}}{\text{True Positives} + \text{False Negatives}}
  \]
- **Example:** For `Low`, a recall of `0.79` means the model identified 79% of all true `Low` instances.

### **F1-Score**
- **Definition:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing the two metrics. It ranges from 0 (worst) to 1 (best).
- **Formula:** 
  \[
  \text{F1-Score} = 2 \cdot \frac{\text{Precision} \cdot \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}}
  \]
- **Example:** For `Very High`, an F1-score of `0.80` indicates a strong balance between precision and recall.

### **Support**
- **Definition:** The number of actual instances of each class in the test set.
- **Example:** For `Medium`, the support of `26` means there are 26 instances labeled as `Medium` in the test set.

## **2. Overall Metrics**
### **Accuracy**
- **Definition:** The percentage of all predictions that were correct.
- **Formula:** 
  \[
  \text{Accuracy} = \frac{\text{Correct Predictions}}{\text{Total Predictions}}
  \]
- **Example:** An accuracy of `0.69` means the model correctly predicted 69% of all instances.

### **Macro Average**
- **Definition:** The unweighted average of precision, recall, and F1-score across all classes.
- **Use Case:** Treats all classes equally, regardless of their frequency.
- **Example:** A macro F1-score of `0.57` means the model performed moderately well across all categories, but the poor precision for `High` likely pulls down the average.

### **Weighted Average**
- **Definition:** The average of precision, recall, and F1-score, weighted by the number of instances in each class (`support`).
- **Use Case:** Accounts for class imbalance and is often more representative of overall model performance.
- **Example:** A weighted F1-score of `0.68` reflects strong performance in the `Very High` and `Low` categories, while the poor performance on `High` has less impact due to its smaller support.

## **3. Explanation of Categories**

### **High**
- **Meaning:** Represents instances with relatively elevated values for the target variable but not the highest.
- **Example:** If tracking emergency visit rates, `High` might mean significantly above-average rates but not at critical levels.

### **Low**
- **Meaning:** Represents instances with relatively low values for the target variable.
- **Example:** For emergency visits, `Low` could indicate areas with well-managed healthcare resources or fewer emergency situations.

### **Medium**
- **Meaning:** Represents intermediate values for the target variable.
- **Example:** For emergency visits, `Medium` could signify areas with moderate visit rates, neither critically high nor exceptionally low.

### **Very High**
- **Meaning:** Represents instances with the highest values for the target variable.
- **Example:** For emergency visits, `Very High` might indicate areas experiencing a healthcare crisis or an overload of emergency visits.

## **4. Insights and Observations**
1. **Performance by Category:**
   - **"Very High" and "Low" categories perform the best**, with high precision, recall, and F1-scores.
   - **"High" has the poorest performance**, likely due to fewer instances (11 support), making it harder for the model to learn patterns.

2. **Impact of Class Imbalance:**
   - **"Very High" (53 instances)** has the strongest representation, contributing to better performance for this category.
   - **"High" (11 instances)** has the weakest representation, leading to poor precision and recall.

3. **Model Limitations:**
   - The **macro F1-score of 0.57** reflects a lack of balance in performance across all categories.
   - The model struggles to generalize for underrepresented classes (`High`), indicating a potential need for data resampling or improved feature engineering.

## **5. Real-World Context for Emergency Visits**
- **"Very High":** Regions or timeframes experiencing critical stress, possibly due to pandemics, disasters, or systemic healthcare challenges.
- **"High":** Substantial but manageable stress, perhaps in densely populated areas or during flu seasons.
- **"Medium":** Normal or average levels of healthcare utilization.
- **"Low":** Areas with fewer emergency visits, likely due to effective preventative care or lower population density.
