#multinomial-regression3 README - what does the data actually mean?


### **1. Metrics for Each Category:**
The report evaluates the model's performance for each target class (`High`, `Low`, `Medium`, `Very High`) using the following metrics:

#### **Precision:**
- **Definition:** The percentage of predicted instances for a class that were correct.
- **Formula:** \( \text{Precision} = \frac{\text{True Positives}}{\text{True Positives} + \text{False Positives}} \)
- **Example:** For `High`, a precision of `0.25` means that only 25% of the instances predicted as `High` were actually correct.

#### **Recall (Sensitivity):**
- **Definition:** The percentage of actual instances of a class that the model correctly identified.
- **Formula:** \( \text{Recall} = \frac{\text{True Positives}}{\text{True Positives} + \text{False Negatives}} \)
- **Example:** For `Low`, a recall of `0.79` means the model identified 79% of all true `Low` instances.

#### **F1-Score:**
- **Definition:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing the two metrics. It ranges from 0 (worst) to 1 (best).
- **Formula:** \( \text{F1-Score} = 2 \cdot \frac{\text{Precision} \cdot \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}} \)
- **Example:** For `Very High`, an F1-score of `0.80` means a strong balance between precision and recall.

#### **Support:**
- **Definition:** The number of actual instances of each class in the dataset.
- **Example:** For `Medium`, the `support` of `26` means there are 26 instances labeled as `Medium` in the test set.

### **2. Accuracy:**
- **Definition:** The percentage of all predictions that were correct.
- **Formula:** \( \text{Accuracy} = \frac{\text{Correct Predictions}}{\text{Total Predictions}} \)
- **Example:** An accuracy of `0.69` means the model correctly predicted 69% of all instances.

---

### **3. Macro Average:**
- **Definition:** The unweighted average of precision, recall, and F1-score across all classes.
- **Use Case:** This treats all classes equally, regardless of their frequency.
- **Example:** A macro F1-score of `0.57` means the model performed moderately well across all categories, but the lower precision for `High` likely pulls down the average.

---

### **4. Weighted Average:**
- **Definition:** The average of precision, recall, and F1-score, weighted by the number of instances in each class (`support`).
- **Use Case:** This accounts for class imbalance and is often more representative of overall model performance.
- **Example:** A weighted F1-score of `0.68` means that while `Low` and `Very High` performed well, the poor performance on `High` had less impact due to its smaller support.

---

### Insights:
1. **"Very High" and "Low" categories perform the best**, with high precision, recall, and F1-scores.
2. **"High" has the poorest performance**, indicating the model struggles to differentiate this category from others.
3. The **accuracy of 69%** shows decent overall performance, but the low macro average (0.57) suggests some room for improvement, especially for minority classes like `High`.
